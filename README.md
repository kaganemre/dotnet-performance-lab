# .NET Performance Lab

This repository is a hands-on performance benchmarking lab for exploring and measuring the runtime and memory characteristics of .NET code.  
It uses BenchmarkDotNet to run controlled experiments and compare different implementation approaches based on real-world scenarios.

The goal is to understand how small design and implementation choices impact performance, following a *measure before optimize* mindset.
